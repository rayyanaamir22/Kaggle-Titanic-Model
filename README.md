# Kaggle-Titanic-Model

## Description
XGBoost Classifier that predicts whether a passenger would survive or not. Designed for the Kaggle Titanic competition and trained on the corresponding dataset.

## Predict
Use the file predict.py to feed information and get the result. This script prettifies the process, recieving input via console prompts and outputting a sympathetic message.
For quicker results, ignore the function "getPassengerData" and make the dictionary "testSubject" manually with the exact category names as keys and the right types as values.
